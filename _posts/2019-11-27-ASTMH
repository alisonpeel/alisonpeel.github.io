Becky Bengtsson and Kate travelled to Washington DC to present Becky's early results from analysis of *Shigella* from the Global Enteric Multicentre Study at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 

Becky presented her findings relevant to population structure, antimicrobial resistance and predicted vaccine efficacy based on the genomic analysis of isolates from the study.

We then enjoyed a visit with our key collaborator Associate Professor Sharon Tennant (who was awarded the xxx medal at the conference - Congratulations Sharon!) at the Centre for Vaccine Development, University of Maryland.  

Well done Becky and thanks for hosting us Sharon!
